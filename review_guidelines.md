# Guidelines for letter review

This is a checklist that all reviewers will go through when they receive a
letter.

1. Run the text through the Gender-Bias calculater to obtain an initial
   percentage of male- and female-associated words.
   a) If we can get other forms of this calculator - race, geneder in other coutries, etc. then add them here. 
2. Check for typos and grammar.
3. Provide replacement possibilities for descriptive words in letters that
   are highly male-biased or female-biased.
4. Consider the context of words and phrases that may change their
   stereotypical associations. For example, "magnetospheric driven processes", while driven is a masuline coded word, in this example it is not describing the applicant but instead the science process.  
5. Look for examples that have stereotypical associates or could be replaced
   with a different example with more positive associations. e.g. "completed all tasks asigned" vs "Led independent research"
6. Please allow 5-10 business days for a response (or whatever time frame people want to give, but we need to come up with some time frame).
