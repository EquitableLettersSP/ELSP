# Guidelines for letter review

This is a checklist that all reviewers will go through when they receive a
letter.

1. Run the text through the Gender-Bias calculater to obtain an initial
   percentage of male- and female-associated words.
2. Check for typos and grammar.
3. Provide replacement possibilities for descriptive words in letters that
   are highly male-biased or female-biased.
4. Consider the context of words and phrases that may change their
   stereotypical associations.
5. Look for examples that have stereotypical associates or could be replaced
   with a different example with more positive associations.
