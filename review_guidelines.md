# Guidelines for letter review

This is a checklist that all reviewers will go through when they receive a
letter.

1. Run the text through the Gender-Bias calculater to obtain an initial
   percentage of male- and female-associated words.
2. Check for typos and grammar.
3. Provide replacement possibilities for descriptive words in letters that
   are highly male-biased or female-biased given the context of their use.
4. Consider the context of words and phrases that may change their
   stereotypical associations. For example, "magnetospheric driven processes";
   while driven is a masuline coded word, in this example it is not describing 
   the applicant but instead the science process.  
5. Look for examples that have stereotypical associations or could be replaced
   with a different example with more positive associations. For instance,
   "managed group meeting" vs "Led group research meetings".
6. Obtain a final percentage of male- and female-associated words with the
   Gender-Bias calculater.
7. Please allow 5-10 business days for a response.
