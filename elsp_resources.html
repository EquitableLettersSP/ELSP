                        <li>This <a href="https://thedailytexan.com/2016/11/02/study-reveals-implicit-gender-bias-in-recommendation-letters">newspaper article</a>, "Study reveals implicit gender bias in recommendation letters“ is on a five-year study of 1,000 letters of recommendation for postdoctoral fellowships in the geosciences. It found that female applicants were only half as likely to receive “excellent” letters compared to male applicants, for example, describing applicants as having a “thorough understanding of the subject” versus being a “brilliant scientist and role model” or a “trailblazer.” The author attributes this to implicit or unconscious gender bias <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2819">(Dutt et al. 2016)</a>.</li>

Letters about others (e.g., women, people of color, and students from non-research universities) include more positive emotion and describe the insight of the student, but include more discrepancy and tentative statements.</li>
