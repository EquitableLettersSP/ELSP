# Guidelines for letter review

## Reviewer checklist
This is a checklist that all reviewers will go through when they receive a
letter.

1. Run the text through the Gender-Bias calculater to obtain an initial
   percentage of male- and female-associated words.
2. Check for typos and grammar.
3. Provide replacement possibilities for descriptive words in letters that
   are highly male-biased or female-biased given the context of their use.
4. Consider the context of words and phrases that may change their
   stereotypical associations. For example, "magnetospheric driven processes";
   while driven is a masuline coded word, in this example it is not describing 
   the applicant but instead the science process.  
5. Look for examples that have stereotypical associations or could be replaced
   with a different example with more positive associations. For instance,
   "managed group meeting" vs "Led group research meetings".
6. Consider the letter formatting, looking out for things like excessive blank
   space, unprofessional fonts, and size of signature
7. Obtain a final percentage of male- and female-associated words with the
   Gender-Bias calculater.
8. Please allow 5-10 business days for a response.
