# Guidelines for submitting letters for review

Before submitting your letter for review, please ensure that you have (or are
ready to) meet the following conditions:

- [ ] Remove or redact all personal identifying information (PII). A common
  example that may be appropriate for some letters include grades.
- [ ] Run the letter through a spell checker. Reviewers will also make note of
  spelling and grammar mistakes, but minimizing these will improve the
  reviewer's abillity to focus on identifiying instances of implicit bias.
- [ ] Run the letter through a gender-bias calculator.
- [ ] Provide the institution where the letter will be submitted.
- [ ] Provide the type of position the letter is being written for.
- [ ] Provide 3 suggested reviewers with their current email addresses and
  institutions.
- [ ] Read and agree to the code of conduct (LINK).

Please upload/send your letter for review as a text, .docx, or .pdf file to
equitable.space.letters@gmail.com.  Though we aim for a fast turn-around,
nominal review times are 1 month.
