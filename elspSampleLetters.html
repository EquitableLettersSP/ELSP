                        <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
                        <p><a href="#" class="tooltip">Recently, a couple of us, both Society Fellows, were discussing whom to ask to support a nomination we were considering submitting. One of us mentioned John Smith, but we soon realized that John, himself, was not yet a Society Fellow.<span>This introduction is problematic because it says that John Smith is worthy of this nomination because other people who have this award think he is their peer or friend. This is not a selection criteria and undermines any relevant criteria presented because the letter writer has shown that they are susceptible to cronyism.</span></a> We were stunned by this realization, which struck us as a significant oversight by our community. 
                                
                        <a href="#" class="tooltip">We immediately changed our focus from our previous nominee to prepare the more deserving nomination of John.<span>This builds John up by putting down other people in the community. A statement like this one would be even more egregious if the letter writer participated in multiple nomination packages.</span></a> He is a leader in the fundamental physics fields of Stuff and Time Travel, areas in which John and I have pursued many fruitful collaborations. John has provided community leadership by pioneering diversity and inclusion efforts. It is my great pleasure to nominate Dr. John Smith for induction into the Society as a Fellow for his discoveries in Stuff and Time Travel.</p>

                        <p>This letter provides my most enthusiastic support for the induction of Dr. J. Smith into the Society as a Fellow. <a href="#" class="tooltip">John is the foremost contributor<span>A statement like this will undermine the nominee if anyone in the nomination committee disagrees with this statement. Unless it is truly undisputable, using strong and inclusive language such as "one of the leading contributors" would be more believable</span></a> to establishing the link between fundamental physics topic 1 (Stuff) and fundamental physics topic 2 (Time Travel) in our era, with numerous important implications of his discoveries readily found in this subfield, as well as in other subfields. John is a brilliant physicist who has made significant contributions to our understanding of a wide range of physics aspects, using his high-level analytical skills. His research is primarily theoretical, but he has always emphasized the connection of basic physics with observations. John is amply deserving of the Society Fellowship on the basis of both the depth and breadth of his sustained contribution to Physics and the research interests of the Society Fellowship Committee. <a href="#" class="tooltip">The results of his research have far-reaching implications in Astrophysics<span>Statements like this should be supported with examples whose full references are included in the nomination package CV. It is also useful to number these references consistently in all nomination letters and the CV to improve package legibility</span></a>. <a href="#" class="tooltip">John's exceptional talent has been widely recognized by other societies; he is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and has been the recipient of many highly prestigious community awards<span>Unless past awards are a part of the award selection criteria, this space in the letter would be better spent establishing the truth of the previous statement with research examples.</span></a>.</p>

                        <p>Delving into the substance of John's extensive body of work, one finds areas of significant impact too numerous to detail here. Some highlights must suffice: he literally "wrote the book" with his contributions to The Physics of Stuff with Banner, Stark, et al., <a href="#" class="tooltip">the essential textbook for graduate students everywhere<span>Again, this needs to be supported with examples unless it is as widely used and referenced as Jackson's "Classical Electromagnetics".</span></a>. <a href="#" class="tooltip">His collaboration with Dr. Emitt Brown resulted in a<span>This is a rough transition from the previous statement. It can be easily fixed by fleshing out the previous claim and beginning a new paragraph.</span></a> <a href="#" class="tooltip">seminal series of papers, in which John revealed the physics of flux capacitors<span>Again, provide references.</span></a>. These are the essential building blocks of our understanding of such diverse phenomena as time travel, temporal paradox, and ionized hydrogen and helium of interstellar origin. John also initiated the study that led to the full description of the instabilities that define the parameter-space boundaries of Stuff. He notably established the limiting factors for these boundaries.</p>

                        <p>John <a href="#" class="tooltip">has numerous studies that define the role and limits of Tangentially Related Thing<span>The letter writer may not want to include it if this research is not relevant to the current award. It is important to focus only on the research contributions that support the current award and, if presenting tangentially related areas, to provide context that will convince the nomination committee that this is both relevant and important.</span></a>. The fundamental importance of John Smith's research has ensured that it has transformed our understanding of many other fundamental topics, nearly all of which have major implications for understanding the environment and explaining observations. Many of the ideas developed by John have implications that stretch from the state-of-the-art observations to deeper theoretical processes, bridging communities from experimentalists to theorists, and involving dozens of research groups and many authors.</p>

                        <p>John has also made many other important contributions in fundamental physics of his research field. <a href="#" class="tooltip">He is the world's foremost authority on the physical properties of specific processes in his field<span>A statement this strong requires indisputable back-up, probably by references to several publications in highly influential journals (e.g., Science or Nature). And if it's related to the work brought up in the previous paragraphs, it would be better to mention it there.</span></a>. The breakthroughs he made in this area provide the science foundation for the revolutionary studies expected with a number of upcoming Big Missions.</p>

                        <p>Another science area that John has pioneered is the study of Something Completely Different. He, along with his team on another Big Mission, <a href="#" class="tooltip">performed the first measurements of its kind<span>Provide reference to the first measurements here.</span></a>. These measurements opened up a whole new area of study <a href="#" class="tooltip">and has spawned a host of investigations by the outside community<span>Provide a few references with John Smith as a collaborator.</span></a>. However, as important as these measurements are, their impact would have been trivial without John. <a href="#" class="tooltip">He developed the infrastructure at State College University (SCU) to allow the entire research community to access the Big Mission data<span>Provide a reference for the FAIR data here.</span></a>.</p>

                        <p>There is one service contribution to the community that I feel is outstanding and truly deserves recognition: John's commitment to, and promotion of, diversity. <a href="#" class="tooltip">He was highly proactive in establishing diversity in his research team well before there were any incentives to do so<span>A timeline that could be backed up here (e.g., through collaborations with named students) would be useful.</span></a>. <a href="#" class="tooltip">He advocated relentlessly for women hires and was successful at obtaining a position for his ex-student Dr. Jane Doe<span>Advocacy for women is not the same as advocacy for ones students.</span></a>. <a href="#" class="tooltip">Jane was an exceptional student, and, thanks to John's guidance, she has gone on to become the first female tenured professor at her university and is widely considered to be a leader in the field<span>This undermines Jane Doe's accomplishments by giving the credit for her obtaining a job to her advisor.</span></a>. John has pushed for diversity in all areas of science and engineering within his team. <a href="#" class="tooltip">Without his efforts, we would not have any women in some of the highest positions in our field<span>Again, this gives John the credit for work done by other people and implicitly states that the women in the field are not capable of attaining these positions without being given them by a man.</span></a>. John's efforts advancing diversity in science are truly unmatched.</p>

                        <p>In summary, Dr. Smith embodies the best ideals of the Society Fellowship: <a href="#" class="tooltip">Iconic contributions to science with a broad impact, unparalleled science and community leadership, and the reason we have so much diversity and diversity programs in our field<span>This sentence embodies many of the problems seen throughout the letter. Better wording would be: "Iconic contributions to Stuff and Time Travel, broad scientific impacts across related disciplines, and strong community leadership that encourages collaborative science, inclusive research groups, and diversity within the field."</span></a>. His research continues to elevate the Physics disciplines and influences and leads the international science community. He is an exceptional candidate for the Society Fellowship, <a href="#" class="tooltip">whose recognition is long past due<span>This is a contentious statement that would best be omitted, as it clearly says the letter writer thinks members of the nomination committee haven't been doing a good job in the last few years.</span></a>. <a href="#" class="tooltip">All of the scientists I consulted in preparing for this nomination had assumed that John was already a Society Fellow<span>Again, a cronyistic statement that places the letter writer and their friends in a peer group above the award committee in the scientific hierarchy.</span></a>. <a href="#" class="tooltip">It is time to rectify this error and select John Smith for the Society Fellowship<span>Instead of saying mistakes were made in the past, end by providing support for your nominee: "Dr. John Smith has my strongest support for the Society Fellowship." It is also important, when including such phrases in multiple nomination letters, to use the same language to avoid making comparisons. If, as a letter writer, you find yourself using comparative language for different nominees only write for those for whom you can give your strongest support and let other people write letters for those you do not feel you can support wholeheartedly.</span></a>.</p>

                        <p>Fellow Evaluation Committee,</p>

                        <p>I am writing to show my support for Dr. Jane Smith to receive the Society Fellowship for their work in making great discoveries and having had a sustained impact on our field, as well as for their technical acumen and outreach.</p>

                        <p>I have known <a href="#" class="tooltip">Jaynie (as I call her)<span>Using a diminuative nickname (e.g., Robbie, Mashka, Pepito) is considered rude or vulgar in formal situations (depending on the culteral background of the reader) and also leads the reader to view the nominee as less established in their field, due to the common use of diminuative nicknames by children.</span></a> for the last 30 years. In that time, we have collaborated together on multiple investigations. <a href="#" class="tooltip">Perhaps most notably, we worked closely together on the Important Committee, where I was Chair (and Jaynie was Vice-Chair)<span>The wording here undermines Dr. Smith by presenting the nominator's position as chair of the committee as a the main thesis of the sentence.  The same information could have been stated in a way that emphasised the nominee, "Recently, Dr. Smith and I worked together on the Important Committee as Vice-Chair and Chair, respectively."</span></a>. This gave me substantial insight into Jaynie's abilities and management style. From my close association with Jaynie on Important Committee, I would say that Jaynie was very effective in communicating the work of the Steering Committee. We (as Chair and Vice-Chair, respectively) were blessed with many hard-working and passionate individuals on our Steering Committee. A core group of these people worked tirelessly to complete the writing and editing of the final report. <a href="#" class="tooltip">I would say Jaynie became most effective as the report was rolled out and as it was portrayed to the federal agencies such as NASA, NSF, and NOAA. She is remarkably articulate and can be an effective spokesperson<span>These sentences are 'faint praise', and infer that Dr. Smith was not an effective leader, but well suited to secretarial tasks (such as compliling data prepared by others) and figurehead tasks (such as acting as a spokesperson).</span></a>.</p>

                        <p>After further reviewing Jaynie's record of leadership and management, <a href="#" class="tooltip">she has played mid-level roles in academic administration<span>This is also 'faint praise', calling out Dr. Smith's effectiveness at middle management after the first sentence of the paragraph proports to present her leadership capabilities."</span></a>. <a href="#" class="tooltip">She taught a popular and successful course entitled <em>The Business of Science</em><span>If this is a scientifically oriented award, such as a nomination for Fellow of a scientific body like the American Geophysical Union, then the mention of a popular, introductory level course in a section nominally about leadership is not helpful to the nominee.</span></a>. <a href="#" class="tooltip">To my knowledge, she has also managed hardware programs at State College University (SCU) that have been in the few hundred $K to the several $M funding levels<span>Specifing the low funding levels serves to undermine Dr. Smith's hardware programs."</span></a>. It is clear that <a href="#" class="tooltip">the challenges of managing laboratory, ground instrumentation, and satellite instrument programs are an important component of academic life where she excels<span>Providing clear praise for managerial abilities  and no praise for leadership abilities in a paragraph about leadership and management clearly tells the reader that the nominator does not believe Dr. Smith is a leader."></span></a>.</p>

                        <p>Jaynie's scientific record consists of about 200 refereed publications, plus another several dozen conference proceedings; this is <a href="#" class="tooltip">a respectable record<span>Using 'respectable' as a qualifier marks out Dr. Smith as average in this regard.  In a nomination letter, space should only be given to aspects of a person's career that are above average.  This space could have been used to call out a highly cited or highly influential paper."></span></a> for our sub-discipline. She has also been a guest editor on special edition journals. Put together, <a href="#" class="tooltip">her record demonstrates her willingness to support the larger community<span>This presents Dr. Smith as a good team player, but not a leader or an innovative scientist in her own right."></span></a> through both organization and collaboration. I would point out that during the last couple of years, Jaynie has participated in nearly 50 publications. Jaynie was the first author on several of them, with students or collaborators leading the rest. Obviously, it takes a committed effort to keep publishing papers as the first author while juggling management and leadership duties, but Jaynie has striven to do so.</p>

                        <p>One aspect of Jaynie's work that merits special recognition is her deep connection to observations. Jaynie is an expert on data and on the analysis of the data. She not only develops and runs her own numerical models, she analyzes the observations and validates the models rigorously against these observations. <a href="#" class="tooltip">She has been a pioneer in data-driven modeling, which is currently a popular research topic<span >Calling out this area of research as 'popular' and not 'important' or 'compelling' diminishes Dr. Smith's contribution to the field.></span></a>.</p>

                        <p><a href="#" class="tooltip">Importantly, Jaynie has a pleasant personality, which likely contributes to the large number of people who wish to collaborate with her<span>Two aspects of this sentence are particularly agregious. First, a nominee's tempermant (so long as it has not led to them breaking any codes of conduct) is not important and should not be remarked upon. Second, it implies that other people only want to work with Dr. Smith because she is pleasant, not because she is a good scientist.</span></a>. In view of the above-mentioned points and Jaynie's impressive track record of research, supervising, and service in the international physics communities, I strongly feel that <a href="#" class="tooltip">Jaynie should be honored with a Society Fellowship<span>The phrasing undermines the nomination by implying that Dr. Smith would benefit from recieving this award, and not that the scientific society would benefit from having Dr. Smith join their ranks."></span></a>.</p>

                        <p>A final note about Jaynie is that she is a generous mentor. She has supervised a large number of postdoctoral researchers and young scientists. Many of these people are now prominent members of the community in their own right, such as Dr. Tom Baker<span>It's good to point out the role a nominee has in growing the community without assigning the student's achievements to the mentor or advocator.  However, the constrast between this sentence and the following sentence reveals a strong gender bias.</span></a>. <a href="#" class="tooltip">Her focus on mentoring and providing support and advice for the young ladies in her department has also positively impacted the community<span>Referring to a female scientist or student as a 'young lady' is not appropriate in a professional context.  Also, contrast the introduction of a former male student Dr. Baker as a 'prominent member of the community' to former female students Dr. Janeway, Song, and Anderson as community members who are guided and supported by Dr. Smith.</span></a>; Drs. Katherine Janway, River Song, and Dana Anderson count among her female protegés. She has been a tremendous inspiration to me; her dissertation defense was one of the first that I witnessed when I started graduate school, setting the tone and expectations towards which I strive.</p>

                        
                            <p>Sincerely,

John and I both attended the Legion Academy in the 1970s, where John quickly demonstrated his ability to grasp the fundamentals of space-time travel and connect these basics to current open questions. Since our introduction, John and I have continued to collaborate, and it has been a pleasure to see him succeed in his career. <a href="#" class="tooltip">In my nomination letter I will provide a broad overview of John's sustained impact and breakthroughs, highlighting where the supporting letters, CV, and bibliography will provide more information.<span>This helps the reader to navigate the package where the nomination letter is an overview and points to where more detail can be found in the package material.</span></a></p>

                        <p>John <a href="#" class="tooltip">is one of the foremost contributors<span>This highlights him as exceptional while acknowledging the subjective nature of who may be considered the best at the moment. While this is first and foremost a good practice, it also will stop any debates among the committee about who is the best, thus taking time away from discussing Johns nomination.</span></a> working towards establishing the link between Space-Time Travel and Exo-Biology in our era. <a href="#" class="tooltip">Through his numerous cross-disciplinary collaborations<span>This starts the discussion of how he contributes and enables the collaborative nature of science. It also shows that he and the nominator are not giving him credit for what others have done and contributed to.</span></a>, John has been able to show how his work has made important implications in the subfield of Time Travel, as well as in other subfields such as Space Travel. While his research is primarily theoretical, he has always emphasized the connection of basic physics with observations. John is amply deserving of the Society Fellowship on the basis of both the depth and breadth of his sustained contribution to Physics and the research interests of the Society Fellowship Committee. The results of his research have far-reaching implications in multiple disciplines and each of the submitted letters will reflect on these areas. <a href="#" class="tooltip">The supporting letter by Dr. Emitt Brown will highlight their work on flux capacitors and their initial attempts at time (sans space) travel. Dr. Eleanor Arroway will then discuss their work on the necessary interconnectedness of space-time travel and the success of their experimental work. This will be followed by the letter from Dr. Binti from Oomza University focusing on John's encompassing enthusiasm to embrace new scientific paradigms and collaborations, demonstrating how these qualities distinguish him as a role model for being a supportive collaborator and leading by example in building a trans disciplinary team which enabled their work and its impact on exobiology<span>A more extended summary of the upcoming letters and clue in the readers as to why they may not hear in detail about the aspects of John's research mentioned above.</span></a>.</p>
                        
                        <p><a href="#" class="tooltip">John has an extensive publication record that is the product both of his scientific creativity and the care he takes to build and maintain collaborations<span>This sentence uses strong adjectives and presents him as an active collaborator instead of as a supporting player in a larger group.</span></a>. His work with Dr. Emitt Brown resulted in a series of seminal papers, in which John revealed the physics of flux capacitors <a href="#" class="tooltip">[see bibliography section Time-travel and specifically Brown and Smith, 2020, reviews in dimensional paradox]<span>This helps to back up claims of John's work. This also is an example of how to point to and use the bibliography section requested in the AGU honor's call.]</span></a>. These are the essential building blocks of our understanding of such diverse phenomena as time travel <a href="#" class="tooltip">[e.g., Smith et al, 1682 Royal Society], temporal paradox [e.g., Dax et al, 2380, Bajoran Journal of Physics, Smith and La Forge, 2370, United Federation of Planets Technical Report], and ionized hydrogen and helium of interstellar origin [Parker and Smith, 2018, Journal of Space Weather Space Climate]. This work led to new collaborations with Dr. Arroway that incorporated the principles of his work on time travel into her theoretical construct of interstellar space travel [e.g., Smith and Arroway, 2021, The Astrophysical Journal and in the bibliography under section Space-Time Travel]<span>Throughout the letter, but specifically here, we have shown the diverse collaborations (with respect to gender, nationality, career stage, and scientific discipline) that Dr. Smith has. This provides evidence for the upcoming claim that Dr. Smith is dedicated to improving diversity and creating a culture of inclusion in his scientific teams.</span></a>. <a href="#" class="tooltip">Together, John Smith and Eleanor Arroway wrote The Physics of Space-Time Travel, which has since become an essential textbook for graduate students everywhere (it has currently been translated into 10 different languages)<span>This appropriately shares credit (there is more than enough to go around) and demonstrates that this book is essential through a quantitative metric – it has been translated into 10 different languages.</span></a>. This work and John's enthusiasm and continual curiosity led him to reach out to Dr. Binti and Dr. Claire Finn to explore more fully the implication of the new fields that his work with Dr. Arroway had opened up <a href="#" class="tooltip">[e.g., Binti, Arroway, Finn, and Smith., 2420, Planetary Union Journal of Universe, Space, and Time travel, Smith, Arroway, and Dax 2000, JGR Space Physics, and the Bibliography section Cross-Disciplinary and Cross Dimensional work]<span>These references provide evidence for the claim in the sentence.</span></a>. <a href="#" class="tooltip">Perhaps one of the themes throughout John's research is his love of learning, his continual interest in working with colleagues who will challenge him, and his support of their many endeavors<span>These references provide evidence for the claim in the sentence.</span></a>. John has shown a fearlessness to tackle any new area of research which his studies may lead him.  Many of the ideas developed by John have implications that stretch from the state-of-the-art observations to deeper theoretical processes, bridging the experimental to theoretical communities, involving dozens of research groups and many authors <a href="#" class="tooltip">[see CV section Collaborations and Service]<span>This is an example of how to use the CV to provide evidence for claims in the nomination and supporting letters.</span></a>.</p>
                        <p>John has also made many other contributions in fundamental physics. He is an intertemporally acknowledged authority on the physical properties of specific processes in his field [e.g. Smith, Bohr, and Who, 1930, On the Constitution of time particles]. The breakthroughs he made in this area provide the science foundation for the revolutionary studies expected with a number of upcoming Big Missions [e.g. B & T's Phone Booth PI'd by Dr. Carlin]. Another scientific field that John has pioneered is the study of Exo-Biology. He, along with his team on the Blue Box Mission PI'd by Dr. River Song, performed the first measurements of its kind. <a href="#" class="tooltip">These measurements opened up a whole new area of study and has spawned a host of investigations by the outside community<span>This sentence is an accumulation of the letter building up his research story. Specifically, here we show how an in-depth single specialty study led to broad cross-disciplinary work through diverse collaborations. It is important to show this progression instead of stating that it happened.</span></a>. <a href="#" class="tooltip">However, as important as these measurements are, their impact would have been trivial without John's dedication to open science.  He developed the infrastructure at Pacific Tech which guaranteed the research community access to the Blue Box and T&B Phone Booth data<span>It clearly shows the impact on the community and does not give credit to John that is undeserved. What he did was opened up new science for a lot of other people (‘… has spawned a host of investigations by the outside community'). The open data helps to further back up this claim.</span></a>.</p>
                        
                        <p>John's research community contributions deserve recognition. <a href="#" class="tooltip">Beyond the standard of reviewing papers, serving on panels, and committee work, John advocates relentlessly for his collaborators and works tirelessly towards building an inclusive and safe environment for all to work in [See CV section on Service]<span>This establishes that he does not just the baseline expected service amount. The ‘more' is diversity without explicitly saying it. It shows a commitment to diversity in the context of good science.</span></a>.  John sets the bar in how to make sure to give credit where credit is due. <a href="#" class="tooltip">While he is often one of the more recognizable names on papers, he routinely calls out the work done by his collaborators in his own presentations and (as noted by more than one conference convener) will re-direct credit for work mistakenly attributed to him by his peers to his collaborators when appropriate [See CV section Presentations – "It Takes a Team to Innovate New Physics and Safe Space-Time Travel", Plenary at the Fall AGU meetings 1920, 2020, 2120]<span>Here is explicit evidence through both through anecdotal evidence – but not all hearsay as one can go look at the conference material – of his commitment to equaty and inclusion efforts.</span></a>. John is a true role model of how to be a good collaborator.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Smith embodies the best ideals of the Society Fellowship: contributions to science with a <a href="#" class="tooltip">broad impact and unparalleled, humble, and sustained scientific and community leadership<span>These are good adjectives. While ‘unparalleled' and ‘scientific' are male biased, all other adjectives are gender neutral.</span></a>. <a href="#" class="tooltip">His research through his collaborations continues to elevate the Physics disciplines and influences and leads the international science community<span>This sentences reminds the reader that his work is important and has been impactful.</span></a>. He is an exceptional candidate for the Society Fellowship and embodies the qualities that the Society looks to uphold.</p>

                        <p>Dear Professor Lopez:</p>

                        <p><a href="#" class="tooltip">I am writing this letter<span>According to the gender bias calculator this letter is only 2% male-biased.</span></a> on behalf of Dr. John Smith, in support of his application to your postdoctoral fellowship at Lab U. I have had the privilege of interacting, collaborating, supporting, and mentoring Dr. Smith while he was a graduate student at University College School, and seen him blossom into a promising young scientist. I have truly found it fulfilling to have such a passionate, reliable, and intelligent student like Dr. Smith as part of my research group over the past 5.5 years.</p>

                        <p><a href="#" class="tooltip">Dr. Smith came to University College School relatively naïve and knew little about conducting independent research. But, I have seen Dr. Smith grow over the last 5.5 years in a way that few here have taken the time to notice. Dr. Smith quality of work has and continues to be very good, and his ability to work cooperatively and supportively with other students and professors has been top-notch.<span>This entire paragraph is relatively lazily written and doesn't offer much in the way of concrete discussion about Dr. Smith's attributes. Some of the details are even unnecessary.</span></a> <a href="#" class="tooltip">Given some of the personal conversations Dr. Smith and I have had in the past, it was surprising that others did not find him to be intimidating, but rather cooperative and forthright.<span>This is an example of an unnecessary sentence, and frankly isn't even polite. Dr. Smith's demeanor is not what the postdoctoral fellowship is interested, but rather his research acumen.</span></a></p>

                        <p>Dr. Smith just recently defended his dissertation entitled "Tropospheric Weather and Space Weather... Not so Different After All?", <a href="#" class="tooltip">and after much effort, gave a surprisingly decent presentation.<span>This is also not necessary for two reasons. 1.) The effort required here is not given the proper context; 2.) "Surprisingly decent" makes Dr. Smith seem unprepared or even perhaps incapable of defending his dissertation. It would seem as if the writer of this letter should not be writing this letter in the first place.</span></a> <a href="#" class="tooltip">To get this point Dr. Smith had to overcome a number of obstacles including funding issues, family problems, etc., which demonstrates how motivated an individual he truly is. I know what it is like being a first-generation college and graduate student so for Dr. Smith to really excel here at University College School is a true testament to his resolve.<span>Context matters. Here there is no reason to bring up these types of personal issues in a letter. Specifically, leaving out the specific issues Dr. Smith faced "including funding issues, family problems, etc." could be eliminated from this sentence it would reach just fine.</span></a></p>

                        <p>Dr. Smith's academic and research record is one of a talented researcher, <a href="#" class="tooltip">especially given where he started<span>Again, context matters. Unless the recommender is going to spend time discussing where Dr. Smith started, and has gotten permission from Dr. Smith to discuss such issues. This statement is unnecessary.</span></a>. During his tenure here at University College School, he published 3 first-authored peer review journal papers, and 2 as second or third author. He also presented his work 10 times at National or International meetings (oral presentation or posters), for which he has won one award for an outstanding oral presentation by a graduate student. He his competent in a number of computer languages and tends to pick up new ones quickly compared to his peers. He has actively mentored undergraduate students through a number of different programs here on campus. <a href="#" class="tooltip">However, these tended to distract him at times.<span>Avoid irrelevant information. Mentoring students is a good thing, along with giving back to your local community. It should be framed as such.</span></a> Nonetheless, he was an important contributor to my research group and was always dependable when it came to proposal, research, and/or coursework deadlines.</p>

                        <p>To summarize Dr. Smith is a capable scientific researcher with the programming talent that would be needed to succeed in this Postdoctoral fellowship. <a href="#" class="tooltip">Further, Dr. Smith comes from a low-income upbringing, is a first-generation college student, as well as a person of color in STEM.<span>Again, context matters. The recommender has not done a good enough job discussing why these things are important to Dr. Smith's candidacy by providing the proper context throughout the letter. If the recommender would have done a good job and framing these things about Dr. Smith as part of the letter a statement like this could be warranted.</span></a> All of these things coupled with his research acumen make him a rare individual, and an asset to any research group. <a href="#" class="tooltip">He is unassuming, diligent, and hard-working.<span>Example of "non-standout" adjectives more commonly used for women and underrepresented groups.</span></a> He will benefit from and make the best use of the opportunity afforded by this Postdoctoral fellowship, if offered the opportunity.</p>

                        <p>Please feel free to contact me with any additional questions.</p>

I have truly found it fulfilling to have such a skilled, reliable, and intelligent scientist like Dr. Smith as part of my research group over the past 5.5 years.</p>

                        <p><a href="#" class="tooltip">Coming out of undergrad with a background in environmental science, Dr. Smith came to University College School knowing very little about Earth's upper atmosphere.<span>This statement reads much better than the opening sentence of the second paragraph of the bad letter. It provides the necessary context as to why Dr. Smith was naïve and had less experience than some other students.</span></a> <a href="#" class="tooltip">But, I have seen Dr. Smith grow over the last 5.5 years into a skilled and quite accomplished physicist, whom any Postdoctoral program would be lucky to have. Dr. Smith quality of work has and continues to be outstanding, and his ability to work cooperatively and supportively with other students and professors has been top-notch. Dr. Smith just recently defended his dissertation entitled "Tropospheric Weather and Space Weather … Not so Different After All?", to which his committee and colleagues in our department gave glowing reviews. I know what it is like being a first-generation college and graduate student so for Dr. Smith to really excel here at University College School is a true testament to his resolve.<span>This paragraph is written with concrete examples, speaks to Dr. Smith's research acumen, and describes his work and focuses solely on that work.</span></a></p>

                        <p><a href="#" class="tooltip">Dr. Smith's academic and research record speaks for itself and is one of a talented researcher.<span>This sentence introduces a paragraph about Dr. Smith's research record in a positive way, only using adjectives that imply this record is excellent.</span></a> During his tenure here at University College School, <a href="#" class="tooltip">he published 3 first-authored peer review journal papers, and 2 as second or third author.<span>This concrete example shows Dr. Smith has leadership potential as a researcher, and is also capable of providing significant contributions as part of a collaboration.</span></a> He also presented his work at numerous national and international meetings, receiving an award for one such oral presentation (the "Society Award for Outstanding Graduate Student Presentations"). He also has been a teaching assistant in two different undergraduate courses including The Physics of Upper Atmospheres and Fluid Mechanics, in both of which he graded homework assignments, proctored exams, held office hours (which I am told the students found particularly useful), and gave lectures. <a href="#" class="tooltip">My colleagues and I were impressed by his rapport with the students, who commented positively on his lectures in their end-of-term reviews.<span>This sentence provides a concrete example that uses a metric commonly used to evaluate professionals at this level and higher along Dr. Smith's current career track.</span></a> <a href="#" class="tooltip">He has also taken a leadership role in the community by serving on a number of committees, most notably the diversity, equity, and inclusion committee here in our department. Lastly, he has actively mentored undergraduate students through a number of different programs here on campus, which I have found particularly impressive.<span>These two sentences greatly improve what is written about Dr. Smith's work with students, and later connects it to a strength of Dr. Smith.</span></a> His dedication to mentoring undergraduate students, coupled with his other service activities and outstanding academic acumen, speaks directly to Dr. Smith's high scientific standards and respect for others.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Smith is a brilliant computer programmer who is <a href="#" class="tooltip">proficient in several useful languages, including Fortran and Python<span>This example calls out two languages that highlight an ability to deal with large, complex coding projects and modern coding standards.</span></a>, which has allowed him to quickly transition between research projects within my group. <a href="#" class="tooltip">easily balanced conflicting proposal, research, and/or coursework deadlines, to the point that he assisted others in our group at "crunch time."<span>This sentence combines both feminine and masculine coded adjectives, lessening the impact of implicit gender bias.</span></a> <a href="#" class="tooltip">For example, another graduate student of mine and colleague of Dr. Smith was really struggling with completing a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship application, of which Dr. Smith was a recipient of. I personally watched Dr. Smith sit with his colleague for an hour or two every day for the better part of month helping him with preparing his application. This student made a point to come and speak with me how fortunate he was to have the assistance of Dr. Smith and stated "I would not have submitted a successful application without his (Dr. Smith's) help."<span>These type of anecdotes really elevates this letter compared to its counterpart.</span></a></p>

                        <p>To summarize, Dr. Smith is an excellent scientific researcher with the programming and teaching talent to succeed in your Postdoctoral fellowship. <a href="#" class="tooltip">Furthermore, the things Dr. Smith has overcome to excel here at University College School are nothing short of remarkable.<span>This a much stronger statement given the overall context of the letter, without outstating certain things that the recommender may not have had Dr. Smith's permission to share.</span></a> All of these things coupled with his research acumen make him a rare individual, and an asset to any research group. He is an independent researcher who is <a href="#" class="tooltip">confident<span>Example of a "stand-out" adjective.</span></a>, hardworking, and humble.

                        <p>Ms. Smith is currently a Research Programmer here at Gender Race Bias Inc. During her tenure in our research group, Ms. Smith has proved to be invaluable member of our research team. <a href="#" class="tooltip">We have performed countless studies focusing on the upper atmospheres of both Earth and Mars, from which Ms. Smith's responsibility has been developing code to process satellite observations.<span>This sentence could be strengthened by focusing on Mary's work instead of presenting her contribution as a small portion of a large project primarily done by other people.</span></a> <a href="#" class="tooltip">She diligently completed each task assigned to her<span>This phrasing removes her agency.</span></a>, <a href="#" class="tooltip">putting in whatever amount of time was needed to do so<span>This is a gendered perception of a person's abilities.

                        <p>From my meetings with Mary, it is clear that she is passionate about her work. <a href="#" class="tooltip">She has organized and led research meetings with our group, and meets weekly with other colleagues and collaborators<span>This focuses on her secretarial skills, which is gendered. It's placement immediately after discussing her work also leads the reader to associate her role in the team with organizing meetings.
