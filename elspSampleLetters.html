        <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
        <p>Recently, a couple of us, <span class="hoverText" title= "Well aren't WE fancy!">both Society Fellows</span>, were discussing whom to ask to support a nomination we were considering submitting. One of us mentioned John Smith, but we soon realized that John, himself, was not yet a Society Fellow. <span class="hoverText" title= "Well I NEVER!">We were stunned by this realization</span>, which struck us as a significant oversight by our community. We immediately changed our focus from our previous nominee to prepare the more deserving nomination of John.</p>

        <p>This letter provides my most enthusiastic support for the induction of Dr. J. Smith into the Society as a Fellow. John is the foremost contributor to establishing the link between fundamental physics topic 1 (Stuff) and fundamental physics topic 2 (Time Travel) in our era, with numerous important implications of his discoveries readily found in this subfield, as well as in other subfields. John is a brilliant physicist who has made significant contributions to our understanding of a wide range of physics aspects, using his high-level analytical skills. His research is primarily theoretical but he has always emphasized the connection of basic physics with observations. John is amply deserving of the Society Fellowship on the basis of both the depth and breadth of his sustained contribution to Physics and the research interests of the Society Fellowship Committee. The results of his research have far-reaching implications in Astrophysics. John's exceptional talent has been widely recognized by other societies; he is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and has been the recipient of many highly prestigious community awards.</p>

        <p>Delving into the substance of John’s extensive body of work, one finds areas of significant impact too numerous to detail here. Some highlights must suffice: he literally "wrote the book" with his contributions to The Physics of Stuff with Banner, Stark, et al., the essential textbook for graduate students everywhere.  His collaboration with Emitt Brown resulted in a seminal series of papers, in which John revealed the physics of flux capacitors. These are the essential building blocks of our understanding of such diverse phenomena as time travel, temporal paradox, and ionized hydrogen and helium of interstellar origin. John also initiated the study that led to the full description of the instabilities that define the parameter-space boundaries of Stuff. He notably established the limiting factors for these boundaries. He also has numerous studies that define the role and limits of Tangentially Related Thing.  The fundamental importance of John Smith’s research has ensured that it has transformed our understanding of many other fundamental topics, nearly all of which have major implications for understanding the environment and explaining observations. Many of the ideas developed by John have implications that stretch from the state-of-the-art observations to deeper theoretical processes, bridging communities from experimentalists to theorists, and involving dozens of research groups and many authors.</p>

        <p>John has also made many other important contributions in fundamental physics of his research field. He is the world’s foremost authority on the physical properties of specific processes in his field. The breakthroughs he made in this area provide the science foundation for the revolutionary studies expected with a number of upcoming Big Missions. Another science area that John has pioneered is the study of Something Completely Different. He, along with his team on another Big Mission, performed the first measurements of its kind. These measurements opened up a whole new area of study and has spawned a host of investigations by the outside community. However, as important as these measurements are, their impact would have been trivial without John.  He developed the infrastructure at State College University (SCU) to allow the entire research community to access the Big Mission data.</p>

        <p>There is one service contribution to the community that I feel is outstanding and truly deserves recognition: John’s commitment to, and promotion of, diversity. He was highly proactive in establishing diversity in his research team well before there were any incentives to do so. He advocated relentlessly for women hires and was successful at obtaining a position for his ex-student Dr. Jane Doe. Jane was an exceptional student, and, thanks to John's guidance, she has gone on to become the first female tenured professor at her university and is widely considered to be a leader in the field.  John has pushed for diversity in all areas of science and engineering within his team. Without his efforts, we would not have any women in some of the highest positions in our field. John’s efforts advancing diversity in science are truly unmatched.</p>

        <p>In summary, Dr. Smith embodies the best ideals of the Society Fellowship: Iconic contributions to science with a broad impact, unparalleled science and community leadership, and the reason we have so much diversity and diversity programs in our field. His research continues to elevate the Physics disciplines and influences and leads the international science community. He is an exceptional candidate for the Society Fellowship, whose recognition is long past due. All of the scientists I consulted in preparing for this nomination had assumed that John was already a Society Fellow.  It is time to rectify this error and select John Smith for the Society Fellowship. </p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Byg F. Deel</p>
