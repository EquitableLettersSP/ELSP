                        <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
                        <p><span class="hoverText trigger">Recently, a couple of us, both Society Fellows, were discussing whom to ask to support a nomination we were considering submitting. One of us mentioned <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> Smith, but we soon realized that <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span>, <span class="pronoun reflexive hehim">himself</span>, was not yet a Society Fellow.</span> We were stunned by this realization, which struck us as a significant oversight by our community. <span class="hoverText trigger">We immediately changed our focus from our previous nominee to prepare the more deserving nomination of <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span>.</span> <span class="pronoun objective hehim capital">He</span> <span class="pronoun verb-n hehim">is</span> a leader in the fundamental physics fields of Stuff and Time Travel, areas in which <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> and I have pursued many fruitful collaborations. <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> has provided community leadership by pioneering diversity and inclusion efforts. It is my great pleasure to nominate Dr. <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> Smith for induction into the Society as a Fellow for <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> discoveries in Stuff and Time Travel.</p>

                        <!-- Modal content for previous paragraph -->
                        <div class="modal">

                            <p>This introduction is problematic because it says that <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> Smith is worthy of this nomination because other people who have this award think <span class="pronoun objective hehim">he</span> <span class="pronoun verb-n hehim">is</span> their peer or friend. This is not a selection criteria and undermines any relevant criteria presented because the letter writer has shown that they are susceptible to cronyism.</p>

                            <p>This builds <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> up by putting down other people in the community. A statement like this one would be even more egregious if the letter writer participated in multiple nomination packages.</p>
                          </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>This letter provides my most enthusiastic support for the induction of Dr. Smith into the Society as a Fellow. <span class="hoverText trigger"><span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> is the foremost contributor</span> to establishing the link between fundamental physics topic 1 (Stuff) and fundamental physics topic 2 (Time Travel) in our era, with numerous important implications of <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> discoveries readily found in this subfield, as well as in other subfields. <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> is a brilliant physicist who has made significant contributions to our understanding of a wide range of physics aspects, using <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> high-level analytical skills. <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim capital">His</span> research is primarily theoretical, but <span class="pronoun objective hehim">he</span> <span class="pronoun verb-p hehim">has</span> always emphasized the connection of basic physics with observations. <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> <span class="pronoun verb-n hehim">is</span> amply deserving of the Society Fellowship on the basis of both the depth and breadth of <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> sustained contribution to Physics and the research interests of the Society Fellowship Committee. <span class="hoverText trigger">The results of <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> research have far-reaching implications in Astrophysics</span>. <span class="hoverText trigger"><span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span>'s exceptional talent has been widely recognized by other societies; <span class="pronoun objective hehim">he</span> <span class="pronoun verb-n hehim">is</span> a Fellow of the American Physical Society and has been the recipient of many highly prestigious community awards</span>.</p>

                            <p>A statement like this will undermine the nominee if anyone in the nomination committee disagrees with this statement. Unless it is truly undisputable, using strong and inclusive language such as 'one of the leading contributors' would be more believable.</p>

                            <p>Statements like this should be supported with examples whose full references are included in the nomination package CV. It is also useful to number these references consistently in all nomination letters and the CV to improve package legibility.</p>
                          </div>
                        </div>

                            <p>Unless past awards are a part of the award selection criteria, this space in the letter would be better spent establishing the truth of the previous statement with research examples.</p>
                          </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>Delving into the substance of <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span>'s extensive body of work, one finds areas of significant impact too numerous to detail here. Some highlights must suffice: <span class="pronoun objective hehim">he</span> literally "wrote the book" with <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> contributions to The Physics of Stuff with Banner, Stark, et al., <span class="hoverText trigger">the essential textbook for graduate students everywhere</span>. <span class="hoverText trigger"><span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim capital">His</span> collaboration with Dr. Emitt Brown resulted in a</span> <span class="hoverText trigger">seminal series of papers, in which <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> revealed the physics of flux capacitors</span>. These are the essential building blocks of our understanding of such diverse phenomena as time travel, temporal paradox, and ionized hydrogen and helium of interstellar origin. <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> also initiated the study that led to the full description of the instabilities that define the parameter-space boundaries of Stuff. <span class="pronoun objective hehim capital">He</span> notably established the limiting factors for these boundaries.</p>

                            <p>Again, this needs to be supported with examples unless it is as widely used and referenced as Jackson's 'Classical Electromagnetics.'</p>

                            <p>This is a rough transition from the previous statement. It can be easily fixed by fleshing out the previous claim and beginning a new paragraph.</p>

                        <p><span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> <span class="hoverText trigger">has numerous studies that define the role and limits of Tangentially Related Thing</span>. The fundamental importance of <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> Smith's research has ensured that it has transformed our understanding of many other fundamental topics, nearly all of which have major implications for understanding the environment and explaining observations. Many of the ideas developed by <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> have implications that stretch from the state-of-the-art observations to deeper theoretical processes, bridging communities from experimentalists to theorists, and involving dozens of research groups and many authors.</p>

                            <p>The letter writer may not want to include it if this research is not relevant to the current award. It is important to focus only on the research contributions that support the current award and, if presenting tangentially related areas, to provide context that will convince the nomination committee that this is both relevant and important.</p>

                        <p><span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> has also made many other important contributions in fundamental physics of <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> research field. <span class="hoverText trigger"><span class="pronoun objective hehim capital">He</span> <span class="pronoun verb-n hehim">is</span> the world's foremost authority on the physical properties of specific processes in <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> field</span>.

                            <p>A statement this strong requires indisputable back-up, probably by references to several publications in highly influential journals (e.g., Science or Nature).

                        <p>Another science area that <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> has pioneered is the study of Something Completely Different. <span class="pronoun objective hehim capital">He</span>, along with <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> team on another Big Mission,  <span class="hoverText trigger">performed the first measurements of its kind</span>. These measurements opened up a whole new area of study <span class="hoverText trigger">and has spawned a host of investigations by the outside community</span>. However, as important as these measurements are, their impact would have been trivial without <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span>. <span class="hoverText trigger"><span class="pronoun objective hehim capital">He</span> developed the infrastructure at State College University (SCU) to allow the entire research community to access the Big Mission data</span>.</p>

                        <p>In summary, Dr. Smith embodies the best ideals of the Society Fellowship: <span class="hoverText trigger">Iconic contributions to science with a broad impact, unparalleled science and community leadership, and the reason we have so much diversity and diversity programs in our field</span>. <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim capital">His</span> research continues to elevate the Physics disciplines and influences and leads the international science community. <span class="pronoun objective hehim capital">He</span> <span class="pronoun verb-n hehim">is</span> an exceptional candidate for the Society Fellowship, <span class="hoverText trigger">whose recognition is long past due</span>. <span class="hoverText trigger">All of the scientists I consulted in preparing for this nomination had assumed that <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> was already a Society Fellow</span>. <span class="hoverText trigger">It is time to rectify this error and select <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> Smith for the Society Fellowship</span>.</p>

If, as a letter writer, you find yourself using comparative language for different nominees only write for those for whom you can give your strongest support and let other people write letters for those you do not feel you can support wholeheartedly.</p>

                        <p>I am writing to show my support for Dr. <span class="pronoun name sheher">Jane</span> Smith to receive the Society Fellowship for <span class="pronoun possessive-d sheher">her</span> work in making great discoveries and having had a sustained impact on our field, as well as for <span class="pronoun possessive-d sheher">her</span> technical acumen and outreach.</p>

                        <p>I have known <span class="hoverText trigger"><span class="pronoun nickname sheher">Jaynie</span> (as I call <span class="pronoun subjective sheher">her</span>)</span> for the last 30 years. In that time, we have collaborated together on multiple investigations. <span class="hoverText trigger">Perhaps most notably, we worked closely together on the Important Committee, where I was Chair (and <span class="pronoun nickname sheher">Jaynie</span> was Vice-Chair)</span>. This gave me substantial insight into <span class="pronoun nickname sheher">Jaynie</span>'s abilities and management style. From my close association with <span class="pronoun nickname sheher">Jaynie</span> on Important Committee, I would say that <span class="pronoun nickname sheher">Jaynie</span> was very effective in communicating the work of the Steering Committee. We (as Chair and Vice-Chair, respectively) were blessed with many hard-working and passionate individuals on our Steering Committee. A core group of these people worked tirelessly to complete the writing and editing of the final report. <span class="hoverText trigger">I would say <span class="pronoun nickname sheher">Jaynie</span> became most effective as the report was rolled out and as it was portrayed to the federal agencies such as NASA, NSF, and NOAA. <span class="pronoun objective sheher capital">She</span> <span class="pronoun verb-n sheher">is</span> remarkably articulate and can be an effective spokesperson</span>.</p>

                            <p>Using a diminuative nickname (e.g., Robbie, Mashka, Pepito) is considered rude or vulgar in formal situations (depending on the culteral background of the reader) and also leads the reader to view the nominee as less established in their field, due to the common use of diminuative nicknames by children.</p>

                            <p>The wording here undermines Dr. Smith by presenting the nominator's position as chair of the committee as a the main thesis of the sentence.  The same information could have been stated in a way that emphasised the nominee, Recently, Dr. Smith and I worked together on the Important Committee as Vice-Chair and Chair, respectively.'</p>

                            <p>These sentences are 'faint praise', and infer that Dr. Smith was not an effective leader, but well suited to secretarial tasks (such as compliling data prepared by others) and figurehead tasks (such as acting as a spokesperson).</p>

                            <p>If this is a scientifically oriented award, such as a nomination for Fellow of a scientific body like the American Geophysical Union, then the mention of a popular, introductory level course in a section nominally about leadership is not helpful to the nominee.</p>

                            <p>Providing clear praise for managerial abilities  and no praise for leadership abilities in a paragraph about leadership and management clearly tells the reader that the nominator does not believe Dr. Smith is a leader.</p>

I would point out that during the last couple of years, <span class="pronoun nickname sheher">Jaynie</span> has participated in nearly 50 publications. <span class="pronoun nickname sheher">Jaynie</span> was the first author on several of them, with students or collaborators leading the rest. Obviously, it takes a committed effort to keep publishing papers as the first author while juggling management and leadership duties, but <span class="pronoun nickname sheher">Jaynie</span> has striven to do so.</p>

                            <p>Using 'respectable' as a qualifier marks out Dr. Smith as average in this regard.  In a nomination letter, space should only be given to aspects of a person's career that are above average.  This space could have been used to call out a highly cited or highly influential paper.</p>

                            <p>This presents Dr. Smith as a good team player, but not a leader or an innovative scientist in <span class="pronoun possessive-d sheher">her</span> own right.</p>

                            <p>Two aspects of this sentence are particularly egregious. First, a nominee's tempermant (so long as it has not led to them breaking any codes of conduct) is not important and should not be remarked upon. Second, it implies that other people only want to work with Dr. Smith because <span class="pronoun objective sheher">she</span> <span class="pronoun verb-n sheher">is</span> pleasant, not because <span class="pronoun objective sheher">she</span> <span class="pronoun verb-n sheher">is</span> a good scientist.</p>

                            <p>The phrasing undermines the nomination by implying that Dr. Smith would benefit from recieving this award, and not that the scientific society would benefit from having Dr. Smith join their ranks.</p>

                        <p>A final note about <span class="pronoun nickname sheher">Jaynie</span> is that <span class="pronoun objective sheher">she</span> <span class="pronoun verb-n sheher">is</span> a generous mentor. <span class="pronoun objective sheher capital">She</span> <span class="pronoun verb-p sheher">has</span> supervised a large number of postdoctoral researchers and young scientists.

                            <p>It's good to point out the role a nominee has in growing the community without assigning the student's achievements to the mentor or advocator.  However, the constrast between this sentence and the following sentence reveals a strong gender bias.</p>

                        <p><span class="hoverText" title="According to the gender bias calculator this letter is only 2% male-biased.">I am writing this letter</span> on behalf of Dr. <span class="pronoun name hehim">John</span> Smith, in support of <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> application to your postdoctoral fellowship at Lab U. I have had the privilege of interacting, collaborating, supporting, and mentoring Dr. Smith while <span class="pronoun objective hehim">he</span> <span class="pronoun verb-t hehim">was</span> a graduate student at University College School, and seen him blossom into a promising young scientist. I have truly found it fulfilling to have such a passionate, reliable, and intelligent student like Dr. Smith as part of my research group over the past 5.5 years.</p>

But, I have seen Dr. Smith grow over the last 5.5 years in a way that few here have taken the time to notice. Dr. Smith quality of work has and continues to be very good, and <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> ability to work cooperatively and supportively with other students and professors has been top-notch.</span> <span class="hoverText" title="This is an example of an unnecessary sentence, and frankly isn't even polite. Dr. Smith's demeanor is not what the postdoctoral fellowship is interested, but rather <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> research acumen.">Given some of the personal conversations Dr. Smith and I have had in the past, it was surprising that others did not find him to be intimidating, but rather cooperative and forthright.</span></p>

                        <p>Dr. Smith just recently defended <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> dissertation entitled "Tropospheric Weather and Space Weather... Not so Different After All?", <span class="hoverText" title="This is also not necessary for two reasons. 1.) The effort required here is not given the proper context; 2.) 'Surprisingly decent' makes Dr. Smith seem unprepared or even perhaps incapable of defending <span class="pronoun possessive-d hehim">his</span> dissertation. It would seem as if the writer of this letter should not be writing this letter in the first place.">and after much effort, gave a surprisingly decent presentation.</span><span class="hoverText" title="Context matters. Here there is no reason to bring up these types of personal issues in a letter. Specifically, leaving out the specific issues Dr. Smith faced 'including funding issues, family problems, etc.' could be eliminated from this sentence it would reach just fine.">To get this point Dr. Smith had to overcome a number of obstacles including funding issues, family problems, etc., which demonstrates how motivated an individual <span class="pronoun objective hehim">he</span> truly is.

                        <p>Dr. Smith's academic and research record is one of a talented researcher, <span class="hoverText" title="Again, context matters.

                        <p>To summarize Dr. Smith is a capable scientific researcher with the programming talent that would be needed to succeed in this Postdoctoral fellowship. <span class="hoverText" title="Again, context matters.

Talk about the quality of the papers and the good aspects. The word “four” should be spelled out because it’s less than 10 (JGR style guide).

            <p> Dr. Johnson first came to Technical College Institute with a background in pure mathematics.  <span class="pronoun possessive-d theythem capital">Their</span> top-notch mathematical background proved an asset when dealing with the complex gaseous and magnetoionic theories applied in the research program pursued in my Aeronomy Lab. <span class="hoverText" title="This focuses on the character traits that allowed Dr. Johnson to overcome <span class="pronoun possessive-d theythem">their</span> challenges, rather than the difficulties <span class="pronoun reflective theythem">themself</span>. Dr. Johnson’s actions provide a basis for recommendation rather than <span class="pronoun possessive-d theythem">their</span> circumstances.">Dr. Johnson overcame the challenges inherent is changing research fields, a non-trivial task that now grants them a unique perspective when approaching scientific problems. </span> Dr. Johnson is also very passionate about <span class="pronoun possessive-d theythem">their</span> research, and is willing to pursue avenues that others may not see as possible to determine the validity of a hypothesis. </p>

            <p> Over the period of <span class="pronoun possessive-d theythem">their</span> doctoral studies, Dr. Johnson came into <span class="pronoun possessive-d theythem">their</span> own academically and personally. <span class="hoverText" title="This is in fact a strong publication record for someone at this stage of <span class="pronoun possessive-d theythem">their</span> career."> <span class="pronoun objective theythem ">they</span> <span class="pronoun verb-p theythem">have</span> a strong publication record, with four peer-reviewed papers published during the course of <span class="pronoun possessive-d theythem">their</span> degree program. </span> <span class="hoverText" title="This supplies a specific example of the impact of Dr. Johnson’s publications.">For example, the first of Dr. Johnson's publications entitled "A new method of viewing the E-region Ionosphere from LEO Satellite", presented a novel method for viewing a rarely probed region of Earth's atmosphere through use of a new camera technology created in our Aeronomy in collaboration with our graduate students. </span> This one example underscores the <span class="hoverText" title="This distinguishes the skills of Dr. Johnson from <span class="pronoun possessive-d theythem">their</span> peers and is believable because of the previous detailed example."> rare research acumen </span> Dr. Johnson shows in our field. </p>

            <p><span class="hoverText" title="This paragraph gives a good quality of Dr. Johnson that warrants the recommendation, followed by very specific examples of this quality">During Dr. Johnson's tenure here, <span class="pronoun objective theythem ">they</span> excelled at working with external collaborators and presenting <span class="pronoun possessive-d theythem">their</span> work at conferences. Dr. Johnson is an exceptional speaker, and has received three awards for <i>Outstanding Paper/Poster</i> from different professional organizations.  For example, following an invited speaking invitation at the 2019 Aeronomy Fall Meeting, Dr. Johnson was able to foster a collaboration with a prominent engineer in our field, ultimately leading to our new E-region viewing camera technology being incorporated on a new successful mission proposal. It is these types of collaborations and public speaking skills that make Dr. Johnson standout amongst <span class="pronoun possessive-d theythem">their</span> peers.</span></p>
