        <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
        <p><span class="hoverText" title= "This introduction is problematic because it says that John Smith is worthy of this nomination because other people who have this award think he is their peer or friend. This is not a selection criteria and undermines any relevant criteria presented because the letter writer has shown that they are susceptible to cronyism.">Recently, a couple of us, both Society Fellows, were discussing whom to ask to support a nomination we were considering submitting. One of us mentioned John Smith, but we soon realized that John, himself, was not yet a Society Fellow</span>. We were stunned by this realization, which struck us as a significant oversight by our community. <span class="hoverText" title= "This builds John up by putting down other people in the community. A statement like this one would be even more egregious if the letter writer participated in multiple nomination packages.">We immediately changed our focus from our previous nominee to prepare the more deserving nomination of John</span>. He is a leader in the fundamental physics fields of Stuff and Time Travel, areas in which John and I have pursued many fruitful collaborations. John has provided community leadership by pioneering diversity and inclusion efforts.  It is my great pleasure to nominate Dr. John Smith for induction into the Society as a Fellow for his discoveries in Stuff and Time Travel.</p>

        <p>This letter provides my most enthusiastic support for the induction of Dr. J. Smith into the Society as a Fellow. <span class="hoverText" title= "A statement like this will undermine the nominee if anyone in the nomination committee disagrees with this statement. Unless it is truly undisputable, using strong and inclusive language such as “one of the leading contributors” would be more believable">John is the foremost contributor</span> to establishing the link between fundamental physics topic 1 (Stuff) and fundamental physics topic 2 (Time Travel) in our era, with numerous important implications of his discoveries readily found in this subfield, as well as in other subfields. John is a brilliant physicist who has made significant contributions to our understanding of a wide range of physics aspects, using his high-level analytical skills. His research is primarily theoretical, but he has always emphasized the connection of basic physics with observations. John is amply deserving of the Society Fellowship on the basis of both the depth and breadth of his sustained contribution to Physics and the research interests of the Society Fellowship Committee. <span class="hoverText" title= "Statements like this should be supported with examples whose full references are included in the nomination package CV. It is also useful to number these references consistently in all nomination letters and the CV to improve package legibility.">The results of his research have far-reaching implications in Astrophysics</span>. <span class="hoverText" title= "Unless past awards are a part of the award selection criteria, this space in the letter would be better spent establishing the truth of the previous statement with research examples.">John's exceptional talent has been widely recognized by other societies; he is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and has been the recipient of many highly prestigious community awards</span>.</p>

        <p>Delving into the substance of John’s extensive body of work, one finds areas of significant impact too numerous to detail here. Some highlights must suffice: he literally "wrote the book" with his contributions to The Physics of Stuff with Banner, Stark, et al., <span class="hoverText" title= "Again, this needs to be supported with examples unless it is as widely used and referenced as Jackson’s “Classical Electromagnetics”.">the essential textbook for graduate students everywhere</span>.  <span class="hoverText" title= "This is a rough transition from the previous statement. It can be easily fixed by fleshing out the previous claim and beginning a new paragraph.">His collaboration with Dr. Emitt Brown resulted in a </span><span class="hoverText" title= "Again, provide references."></span>seminal series of papers, in which John revealed the physics of flux capacitors</span>. These are the essential building blocks of our understanding of such diverse phenomena as time travel, temporal paradox, and ionized hydrogen and helium of interstellar origin. John also initiated the study that led to the full description of the instabilities that define the parameter-space boundaries of Stuff. He notably established the limiting factors for these boundaries.</p> 
            
        <p>John <span class="hoverText" title= "The letter writer may not want to include it if this research is not relevant to the current award. It is important to focus only on the research contributions that support the current award and, if presenting tangentially related areas, to provide context that will convince the nomination committee that this is both relevant and important.">has numerous studies that define the role and limits of Tangentially Related Thing</span>.  The fundamental importance of John Smith’s research has ensured that it has transformed our understanding of many other fundamental topics, nearly all of which have major implications for understanding the environment and explaining observations. Many of the ideas developed by John have implications that stretch from the state-of-the-art observations to deeper theoretical processes, bridging communities from experimentalists to theorists, and involving dozens of research groups and many authors.</p>

        <p>John has also made many other important contributions in fundamental physics of his research field. <span class="hoverText" title= "A statement this strong requires indisputable back-up, probably by references to several publications in highly influential journals (e.g., Science or Nature). And if it’s related to the work brought up in the previous paragraphs, it would be better to mention it there.">He is the world’s foremost authority on the physical properties of specific processes in his field</span>. The breakthroughs he made in this area provide the science foundation for the revolutionary studies expected with a number of upcoming Big Missions.</p>

        <p>Another science area that John has pioneered is the study of Something Completely Different. He, along with his team on another Big Mission, <span class="hoverText" title= "Provide reference to the first measurements here.">performed the first measurements of its kind</span>. These measurements opened up a whole new area of study <span class="hoverText" title= "Provide a few references with John Smith as a collaborator.">and has spawned a host of investigations by the outside community</span>. However, as important as these measurements are, their impact would have been trivial without John.  <span class="hoverText" title= "Provide a reference for the FAIR data here.">He developed the infrastructure at State College University (SCU) to allow the entire research community to access the Big Mission data</span>.</p>

        <p>There is one service contribution to the community that I feel is outstanding and truly deserves recognition: John’s commitment to, and promotion of, diversity. <span class="hoverText" title= "A timeline that could be backed up here (e.g., through collaborations with named students) would be useful.">He was highly proactive in establishing diversity in his research team well before there were any incentives to do so</span>. <span class="hoverText" title= "Advocacy for women is not the same as advocacy for ones students.">He advocated relentlessly for women hires and was successful at obtaining a position for his ex-student Dr. Jane Doe</span>. <span class="hoverText" title= "This undermines Jane Doe’s accomplishments by giving the credit for her obtaining a job to her advisor.">Jane was an exceptional student, and, thanks to John's guidance, she has gone on to become the first female tenured professor at her university and is widely considered to be a leader in the field</span>.  John has pushed for diversity in all areas of science and engineering within his team. <span class="hoverText" title= "Again, this gives John the credit for work done by other people and implicitly states that the women in the field are not capable of attaining these positions without being given them by a man.">Without his efforts, we would not have any women in some of the highest positions in our field</span>. John’s efforts advancing diversity in science are truly unmatched.</p>

        <p>In summary, Dr. Smith embodies the best ideals of the Society Fellowship: <span class="hoverText" title= "This sentence embodies many of the problems seen throughout the letter. Better wording would be: “Iconic contributions to Stuff and Time Travel, broad scientific impacts across related disciplines, and strong community leadership that encourages collaborative science, inclusive research groups, and diversity within the field.”">Iconic contributions to science with a broad impact, unparalleled science and community leadership, and the reason we have so much diversity and diversity programs in our field</span>. His research continues to elevate the Physics disciplines and influences and leads the international science community. He is an exceptional candidate for the Society Fellowship, <span class="hoverText" title= "This is a contentious statement that would best be omitted, as it clearly says the letter writer thinks members of the nomination committee haven’t been doing a good job in the last few years.">whose recognition is long past due</span>. <span class="hoverText" title= "Again, a cronyistic statement that places the letter writer and their friends in a peer group above the award committee in the scientific hierarchy.">All of the scientists I consulted in preparing for this nomination had assumed that John was already a Society Fellow</span>.  <span class="hoverText" title= "Instead of saying mistakes were made in the past, end by providing support for your nominee: “Dr. John Smith has my strongest support for the Society Fellowship.” It is also important, when including such phrases in multiple nomination letters, to use the same language to avoid making comparisons. If, as a letter writer, you find yourself using comparative language for different nominees only write for those for whom you can give your strongest support and let other people write letters for those you do not feel you can support wholeheartedly.">It is time to rectify this error and select John Smith for the Society Fellowship</span>.</p>

        <p>Fellow Evaluation Committee,</p>

        <p>I am writing to show my support for Dr. Jane Smith to receive the Society Fellowship for their work in making great discoveries and having had a sustained impact on our field, as well as for their technical acumen and outreach.</p>

        <p>I have known <span class="hoverText" title= "Using a diminuative nickname (e.g., Robbie, Mashka, Pepito) is considered rude or vulgar in formal situations (depending on the culteral background of the reader) and also leads the reader to view the nominee as less established in their field, due to the common use of diminuative nicknames by children.">Jaynie (as I call her)</span> for the last 30 years.  In that time, we have collaborated together on multiple investigations. <span class="hoverText" title= "The wording here undermines Dr. Smith by presenting the nominator's position as chair of the committee as a the main thesis of the sentence.  The same information could have been stated in a way that emphasised the nominee, 'Recently, Dr. Smith and I worked together on the Important Committee as Vice-Chair and Chair, respectively.'">Perhaps most notably, we worked closely together on the Important Committee, where I was Chair (and Jaynie was Vice-Chair)</span>. This gave me substantial insight into Jaynie’s abilities and management style. From my close association with Jaynie on Important Committee, I would say that Jaynie was very effective in communicating the work of the Steering Committee. We (as Chair and Vice-Chair, respectively) were blessed with many hard-working and passionate individuals on our Steering Committee. A core group of these people worked tirelessly to complete the writing and editing of the final report. <span class="hoverText" title= "These sentences are 'faint praise', and infer that Dr. Smith was not an effective leader, but well suited to secretarial tasks (such as compliling data prepared by others) and figurehead tasks (such as acting as a spokesperson).">I would say Jaynie became most effective as the report was rolled out and as it was portrayed to the federal agencies such as NASA, NSF, and NOAA. She is remarkably articulate and can be an effective spokesperson</span>.</p>
            
        <p>After further reviewing Jaynie’s record of leadership and management, <span class="hoverText" title= "This is also 'faint praise', calling out Dr. Smith's effectiveness at middle management after the first sentence of the paragraph proports to present her leadership capabilities.">she has played mid-level roles in academic administration</span>. <span class="hoverText" title= "If this is a scientifically oriented award, such as a nomination for Fellow of a scientific body like the American Geophysical Union, then the mention of a popular, introductory level course in a section nominally about leadership is not helpful to the nominee.">She taught a popular and successful course entitled <em>The Business of Science</em></span>. <span class="hoverText" title= "Specifing the low funding levels serves to undermine Dr. Smith's hardware programs.">To my knowledge, she has also managed hardware programs at State College University (SCU) that have been in the few hundred $K to the several $M funding levels</span>. It is clear that <span class="hoverText" title= "Providing clear praise for managerial abilities  and no praise for leadership abilities in a paragraph about leadership and management clearly tells the reader that the nominator does not believe Dr. Smith is a leader.">the challenges of managing laboratory, ground instrumentation, and satellite instrument programs are an important component of academic life where she excels</span>.</p>
            
        <p>Jaynie’s scientific record consists of about 200 refereed publications, plus another several dozen conference proceedings; this is <span class="hoverText" title= "Using 'respectable' as a qualifier marks out Dr. Smith as average in this regard.  In a nomination letter, space should only be given to aspects of a person's career that are above average.  This space could have been used to call out a highly cited or highly influential paper.">a respectable record</span> for our sub-discipline.  She has also been a guest editor on special edition journals. Put together, <span class="hoverText" title= "This presents Dr. Smith as a good team player, but not a leader or an innovative scientist in her own right.">her record demonstrates her willingness to support the larger community</span> through both organization and collaboration. I would point out that during the last couple of years, Jaynie has participated in nearly 50 publications. Jaynie was the first author on several of them, with students or collaborators leading the rest. Obviously, it takes a committed effort to keep publishing papers as the first author while juggling management and leadership duties, but Jaynie has striven to do so.</p>
            
        <p>One aspect of Jaynie’s work that merits special recognition is her deep connection to observations. Jaynie is an expert on data and on the analysis of the data. She not only develops and runs her own numerical models, she analyzes the observations and validates the models rigorously against these observations. <span class="hoverText" title= "Calling out this area of research as 'popular' and not 'important' or 'compelling' diminishes Dr. Smith's contribution to the field.">She has been a pioneer in data-driven modeling, which is currently a popular research topic</span>.</p>
            
        <p><span class="hoverText" title= "Two aspects of this sentence are particularly agregious.  First, a nominee's tempermant (so long as it has not led to them breaking any codes of conduct) is not important and should not be remarked upon.  Second, it implies that other people only want to work with Dr. Smith because she is pleasant, not because she is a good scientist.">Importantly, Jaynie has a pleasant personality, which likely contributes to the large number of people who wish to collaborate with her</span>.  In view of the above-mentioned points and Jaynie’s impressive track record of research, supervising, and service in the international physics communities, I strongly feel that <span class="hoverText" title= "The phrasing undermines the nomination by implying that Dr. Smith would benefit from recieving this award, and not that the scientific society would benefit from having Dr. Smith join their ranks.">Jaynie should be honored with a Society Fellowship</span>.</p>
            
        <p>A final note about Jaynie is that she is a generous mentor. She has supervised a large number of postdoctoral researchers and young scientists. <span class="hoverText" title= "It's good to point out the role a nominee has in growing the community without assigning the student's achievements to the mentor or advocator.  However, the constrast between this sentence and the following sentence reveals a strong gender bias.">Many of these people are now prominent members of the community in their own right, such as Dr. Tom Baker</span>.  <span class="hoverText" title= "Refering to a female scientist or student as a 'young lady' is not appropriate in a professional context.  Also, contrast the introduction of a former male student Dr. Baker as a 'prominent member of the community' to former female students Dr. Janeway, Song, and Anderson as community members who are guided and supported by Dr. Smith.">Her focus on mentoring and providing support and advice for the young ladies in her department has also positively impacted the community</span>; Drs. Katherine Janway, River Song, and Dana Anderson count among her female protegés. She has been a tremendous inspiration to me; her dissertation defense was one of the first that I witnessed when I started graduate school, setting the tone and expectations towards which I strive.</p>

	<span class="hoverText" title= "Contrast the amount of space taken up by this signature to that in the overly-supportive nomination letter.  Hiring and nomination committees take notice of the amount of allowed space used to talk about a nominee or applicant and will notice when this space is not used or filled with unimportant things like a large letterhead or extended signature.">

        <img class="letterhead" src="impressiveLetterhead.jpg">
        <p>I am writing this letter on behalf of Dr. John Smith, in support of his application to your postdoctoral fellowship at Lab U. I have had the privilege of interacting, collaborating, supporting, and mentoring Dr. Smith while he was a graduate student at University College School, and seen him blossom into a promising young scientist. I have truly found it fulfilling to have such a passionate, reliable, and intelligent student like Dr. Smith as part of my research group over the past 5.5 years.</p>

        <p>Dr. Smith came to University College School relatively naïve and knew little about conducting independent research. But, I have seen Dr. Smith grow over the last 5.5 years in a way that few have here have taken the time to notice. Dr. Smith quality of work has and continues to be very good, and his ability to work cooperatively and supportively with other students and professors has been top-notch. Given some of the personal conversations Dr. Smith and I have had in the past, it was surprising that others did not find him to be intimidating, but rather cooperative and forthright.</p>

        <p>Dr. Smith just recently defended his dissertation entitled “Tropospheric Weather and Space Weather … Not so Different After All?”, and after much effort, gave a surprisingly decent presentation.  To get this point Dr. Smith had to overcome a number of obstacles including funding issues, family problems, etc., which demonstrates how motivated an individual he truly is. I know what it is like being a first-generation college and graduate student so for Dr. Smith to really excel here at University College School is a true testament to his resolve.</p>

        <p>Dr. Smith's academic and research record is one of a talented researcher, especially given where he started. During his tenure here at University College School, he published 3 first-authored peer review journal papers, and 2 as second or third author. He also presented his work 10 times at National or International meetings (oral presentation or posters), for which he has won one award for an outstanding oral presentation by a graduate student. He his competent in a number of computer languages and tends to pick up new ones quickly compared to his peers. He has actively mentored undergraduate students through a number of different programs here on campus, however, these tended to distract him at times. Nonetheless, he was an important contributor to my research group and was always dependable when it came to proposal, research, and/or coursework deadlines.</p>

        <p>To summarize Dr. Smith is a capable scientific researcher with the programming talent that would needed to succeed in this Postdoctoral fellowship. Further Dr. Smith comes from a low-income upbringing, is a first-generation college student, as well as a person of color in STEM. All of these things coupled with his research acumen make him a rare individual, and an asset to any research group. He is unassuming, diligent, and hardworking. He will benefit from and make the best use of the opportunity afforded by this Postdoctoral fellowship, if offered the opportunity.</p>

        <p>Please feel free to contact me with any additional questions.</p>

        <p>I am writing this letter on behalf of Dr. John Smith, in support of his application to your postdoctoral fellowship at Lab U. I have had the privilege of interacting, collaborating, supporting, and mentoring Dr. Smith while he was a graduate student at University College School, and seen him blossom into a promising young scientist. I have truly found it fulfilling to have such a skilled, reliable, and intelligent scientist like Dr. Smith as part of my research group over the past 5.5 years.</p>

        <p>Coming out of undergrad with a background in environmental science, Dr. Smith came to University College School knowing very little about Earth’s upper atmosphere. But, I have seen Dr. Smith grow over the last 5.5 years into a skilled and quite accomplished physicist, whom any Postdoctoral program would be lucky to have. Dr. Smith quality of work has and continues to be outstanding, and his ability to work cooperatively and supportively with other students and professors has been top-notch. Dr. Smith just recently defended his dissertation entitled “Tropospheric Weather and Space Weather … Not so Different After All?”, to which his committee and colleagues in our department gave glowing reviews. I know what it is like being a first-generation college and graduate student so for Dr. Smith to really excel here at University College School is a true testament to his resolve.</p>

        <p>Dr. Smith academic and research record speaks for itself and is one of a talented researcher. During his tenure here at University College School, he published 3 first-authored peer review journal papers, and 2 as second or third author. He also presented his work at numerous national and international meetings, receiving an award for one such oral presentation (the “Society Award for Outstanding Graduate Student Presentations”). He also has been a teaching assistant in two different undergraduate courses including The Physics of Upper Atmospheres and Fluid Mechanics, in both of which he graded homework assignments, proctored exams, held office hours (which I am told the students found particularly useful), and gave lectures. My colleagues and I were impressed with how well he connected with students and was able to impart the class material in a way that the students really connected with. He has also taken a leadership role in the community by serving on a number of committees, most notably the diversity, equity, and inclusion committee here in our department. Lastly, he has actively mentored undergraduate students through a number of different programs here on campus, which I have found particularly impressive. His dedication to mentoring undergraduate students coupled with his other service activities and outstanding academic acumen speaks directly to Dr. Smith’s tireless work ethic, the likes of which I have seldom seen in my time at University College School.</p>

        <p>Dr. Smith has also developed his computer programming skills to some of the best I have seen over my 15 years as a Professor at this institution. He is proficient at a number of languages including, Fortran, IDL, Matlab, and Python, which should make any transitions of projects at your institution smooth. He was an important contributor to my research group and was always dependable when it came to proposal, research, and/or coursework deadlines, even assisting with others in our group at “crunch time.” For example, another graduate student of mine and colleague of Dr. Smith was really struggling with completing a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship application, of which Dr. Smith was a recipient of. I personally watched Dr. Smith sit with his colleague for an hour or two every day for the better part of month helping him with preparing his application. This student made a point to come and speak with me how fortunate he was to have the assistance of Dr. Smith and stated “I would not have submitted a successful application without his (Dr. Smith’s) help.”</p>

        <p>To summarize Dr. Smith is an excellent scientific researcher with the programming and teaching talent to succeed in your Postdoctoral fellowship. Furthermore, the things Dr. Smith has overcome to excel here at University College School are nothing short of remarkable. All of these things coupled with his research acumen make him a rare individual, and an asset to any research group. He is independent researcher who is confident, hardworking, and humble. Your institution would be lucky to have, and I know he will benefit from and make the best use of the opportunity afforded by this Postdoctoral fellowship, if offered the opportunity. </p>
